**Abstract**
Land-based inputs, such as runoff, rivers, and submarine groundwater, can alter
biological processes on coral reefs. While the abiotic factors associated with land-
based inputs have strong effects on coral, corals are also affected by biotic
interactions, including other neighboring corals. The biological responses of corals to
changing environmental conditions and their neighbors are likely interactive, however,
few studies address both biotic and abiotic interactions in concert. In a manipulative
field experiment, we tested how the natural environmental gradient created by
submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) affected metabolic rates and endosymbiont
physiology of Porites rus, and how this effect was mediated by intra and interspecific
species interactions. SGD is a natural land-sea interaction that delivers nutrients,
inorganic carbon, and other solutes to coastal ecosystems worldwide. Our results show
that acute SGD exposure generally benefited P. rus, increasing gross photosynthesis,
respiration, endosymbiont densities, and chlorophyll a content along the natural
gradient of nutrient enrichment and pH variability. Conspecifics in direct contact with
the focal coral, however, altered the relationship between coral physiology and SGD,
lowering the photosynthetic and respiration rates from expected values when the coral
had no neighbor. We show that the response of corals to environmental changes is
dependent on the types of nearby neighbors and how neighbors alter the chemical or
physical environment around the coral. Our study underscores the importance of
considering biotic interactions when predicting the physiologic and demographic
responses of corals to the environment.
